# Java Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of simple to intermediate Java programs developed to demonstrate core programming concepts such as control structures, arrays, exception handling, and more.

## ðŸ“‚ Project List

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `SwitchExample.java` | Demonstrates use of the `switch` control structure. |
| `arraylab.java` | Exercises involving array operations. |
| `descending_oddumbers.java` | Prints odd numbers in descending order (likely using loops). |
| `exceptions.java` | Basic demonstration of exception handling in Java. |
| `finaltrial.java` | Final test or trial project (context-specific logic). |
| `frequencyofrating.java` | Calculates or tracks frequency of ratings. |
| `frequencyofratings2.java` | An alternate version of the ratings frequency project. |
| `grading_system.java` | Simple grading system using conditions or switch. |
| `java.java` | Likely a miscellaneous or practice file. |
| `trial.java`, `trial_question1.java`, `trial_question2.java` | Practice questions or trial implementations. |

> ðŸ“Œ Note: These are individual `.java` files and may not follow a single unified package structure. Each file can be compiled and run independently using a Java compiler.

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- JDK 8 or above
- Any text editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
